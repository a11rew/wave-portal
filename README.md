# 😶‍🌫️ Wave Portal

Wave at me over the three webs? Third nether? [Peter's third kick?](https://youtu.be/bR_Yqn1D00w?t=47) Where am I going with this

## Description

Built as part of a [\_buildspace](https://buildspace.so) project, Wave Portal lets you send a message saved in a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain for all to see.

## Getting Started

### Live Example

[https://wave-portal-client-six.vercel.app](https://wave-portal-client-six.vercel.app)

### Development

After cloning, you'll need to install the dependencies:

```
$ cd wave-portal-client
$ yarn
```

Then, start the development server on port 3000:

```
$ yarn start
```

> If you need to update contract specific data (ABI and address) you'd find them in `src/utils`

## Built With
